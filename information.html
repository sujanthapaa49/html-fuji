<h1>Best Tracking Season</h1>
<p>
Nepal Trekking Season by and large referred to best as two seasons after falls and after the winter. The next month mid of September to mid of December consider ever best period of trekking in Himalayas. Amid this time of months have charming atmosphere condition not all that hot and cool and perceivability of mountain are perfectly clear. There is another best period of trekking Nepal after winter when sun getting more hotter in spring time may trekkers to Himalayas can again appreciate agreeable atmosphere condition. In spring season in Nepal a wide range of sorts of blossoms sprout both trees and ground and it is likewise the best time to move up crests for endeavor.
<br>
 As previously mentioned, trekking has become a popular tourist activity and is a great way to see the country. From solo “tea-house trekking” to group cultural treks and rigorous peak trekking up Everest and other mountains, there are a number of hiking and backpacking options available. You can either hire local guides or go through a trekking company.
</p>
<h2>Kathmandu Valley</h2>
<p>The valley around Nepal’s capital is full of temples and pilgrimage sites, such as Boudhanath, Pashupatinath, and the famous Monkey Temple. You can book a private day tour which visits all of the main temples for a very reasonable price.
Bhaktapur is the only place in Nepal which has remained untouched by western culture and it’s recognized by UNESCO as a World Heritage Site.</p>
<h3>Royal Chitwan National Park</h3>
<p>The wildlife tours and jungle safaris are not for the faint of heart! You will have the opportunity to see crocodiles, rhinos, birds, monkeys, sloth bear, and possibly even tigers up close. Unless things have changed since we visited the area, we wouldn’t recommend visiting the Elephant Breeding Center; the elephants are chained and don’t seem to be well taken care of.</p>
<h3>Lumbini Birth Place Of Gautam Buddha</h3>
<p>Lumbini, the birthplace of Lord Buddha, is among the famous tourist places to visit in Nepal. The peaceful ambiance of the city located in the Kapilavasta region is perfect for meditation. The temples and monuments built in accordance with the Buddhist architecture are highly admired. Lord Shiva is known to born in the year 623 BC in Lumbini which is basically in the southern part of Nepal. A lot of people visit Nepal only to see Lumbini. It is said that Lumbini is one of the holiest places in all over the world for the people who follow Buddhism.</p>
<h2>Packing Essentials for Nepal</h2>
<p><strong> Headlamp</strong>: Nepal is the trip that prompted me to ALWAYS keep a headlamp in my carry-on bag. There are power cuts in Nepal that can reach up to 14 hours per day. In addition to fumbling around in the dark in my hotel room, many times I was stuck walking into town in the pitch dark with only the sounds of growling dogs. Come prepared with at least one headlamp and several extra batteries!
<br>
 <strong>Comfortable Shoes</strong>: Another must-have item! Bring comfortable shoes that can be worn with pants or skirts plus a pair of hiking shoes, if you plan on doing any trekking.
 <br>
<strong> Luggage</strong>: I don’t recommend bringing wheeled luggage to Nepal; pack light and bring everything in a large framed backpack. If you do bring wheeled luggage, just be prepared to carry it everywhere. The streets are not conducive to wheeled luggage and many of the hotels don’t have elevators.
 <br>
 <storng>Batteries</storng>: Again, bring extra batteries for your headlamp and/or flashlight.
<br>
 <strong>Voltage Converter & Adapter</strong>: You’ll want a C & D adapter for your electronics and if they cannot handle 220v, then bring a converter too.
<br>
 <srong>Clothing</srong>: Pack comfortable clothes that can be dressed up or down. For the ladies, I recommend bringing a colorful silk scarf to dress up your outfits, a maxi skirt, fleece-lined leggings to wear under a tunic, and a couple of short and long-sleeved cotton t-shirts to layer. Bring the essentials and leave room in your bag to add some local attire!
<br>
 <strong>Hats & Gloves</strong>: Bring a pair of gloves (these are fleece-lined and work with all touch screen devices!) and a winter hat if you are traveling in cooler months or if you’ll be doing any hiking.</p>
<h3>Transportation in Nepal</h3>
<p>once in Nepal, microbuses, taxis, and long-distance tourist buses can get you around from location to location, or you can rent a motorbike. There are also several domestic airlines which provide regular flights between Kathmandu and popular destinations like Pokhara and Bharatpur.

Trekking is also popular amongst tourists, with each region offering its own set of circuits. Treks can be arranged through IPPG approved tourism centers or trekking companies if you wish to join a group or explore less traveled circuits.</p>
